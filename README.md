# Rainfall-Predicton
Our project is about rainfall prediction it predict the rainfall in each state for all the  months form Jan to Dec.
Rainfall prediction is an important area of  research , as it has significant implication for agriculture, water resources management, and disaster preparedness. 
The prediction of rainfall involves the use of various techniques and models ,ranging from statical methods to machine learning algorithms.
A study is conducted and identified solar radiation,perceptible water vapor are important variables for daily rainfall prediction.
This is using data driven machine learning algorithm but it is better to use  simple linear regression which has only one independent feature.
